Report Generation Failed
========================

Report: <%= @scheduled_report.name %>

Hello,

We were unable to generate your scheduled report "<%= @scheduled_report.name %>". The report generation process encountered an error.

Error Details:
--------------
Report Query: <%= @scheduled_report.query %>
Attempted: <%= Time.current.strftime("%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p %Z") %>
<% if @error_message.present? %>
Error: <%= @error_message %>
<% end %>

What you can do:
----------------
- Check if your query is correctly formatted
- Ensure the dataset is still accessible and contains data
- Verify that any referenced columns or fields still exist
- Try running the query manually to identify any issues

You can review and edit your scheduled report settings in your dashboard:
<%= scheduled_report_url(@scheduled_report) %>

Next Attempt:
-------------
<% if @scheduled_report.next_run_at && @scheduled_report.enabled? %>
We will attempt to generate this report again on <%= @scheduled_report.next_run_at.strftime("%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p %Z") %>
<% else %>
This report is currently disabled or not scheduled for future runs.
<% end %>
